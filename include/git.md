    More precisely document since/until bounds. (#1284)
    
    * More precisely document since/until bounds.
    
    Lower in this document, this is expressed as "since <= created_at <= until".
    
    But the English description said that these values had to be "newer than" or "older than".
    
    These two were in conflict. I assume the inclusive behavior is the intended one, since that documentation was added later to clarify. This just makes both cases match.
