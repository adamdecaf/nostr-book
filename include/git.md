    nip34: add refs to repo event
    
    so that the event can be used as a source of truth for the state of refs
    such as branches and tags
    
    this could be useful as:
    
    1. a way to reduce trust in git server(s) so they no longer act as a
       source of truth. a nip34 git remote-helper could proxy requests to
       git servers and only pull updates when they match the state listed in
       the repo event.
    2. a form of authorisation for nip34 git server implementations
       such as song
    3. a way of enabling experimentation with other protocols for hosting
       and accessing git data. eg a blossom git remote helper
```
