## Introduction

Welcome to the nostr-book, which is a streamlined guide to the [Nostr Notes in Progress (NIPs)](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips). Instead of sticking to the original numerical order, I’ve grouped similar NIPs together to make them easier to understand and more practical to use. Whether you’re new to Nostr or a seasoned participant, this reorganized format should help you get a better grip on how things work and what’s being developed.

I want to be clear: I didn’t write the NIPs. All the credit goes to the original authors and contributors of these notes. My contribution has been to sort these NIPs into a flow that makes sense and brings out the connections between them, making everything more accessible.

Each section of this book kicks off with a short introduction to give you a heads-up on what to expect from the NIPs that follow. The goal is to make the technical details a bit friendlier and the big ideas a bit clearer, so more people can join in, understand, and contribute to the Nostr community.

Thanks for picking up this book! I hope it helps you navigate the exciting waters of Nostr more easily and encourages you to dive deeper into this innovative project. Let’s explore and build the future of decentralized communication together!
